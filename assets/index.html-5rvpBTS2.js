It has a single processor executing one instruction stream on one data stream. Most early computers and single-core PCs are examples of this model.</li><li><strong>SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)</strong>: In this model, a single instruction is executed by multiple processing units simultaneously, with each unit acting on a different piece of data. This architecture is highly efficient for tasks with a high degree of regularity, such as graphics or image processing.</li><li><strong>MISD (Multiple Instruction, Single Data)</strong>: This is the rarest class of parallel computer, where multiple instructions operate independently on a single stream of data. A potential application could involve using several different cryptographic algorithms to try and crack a single coded message.</li><li><strong>MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data)</strong>: This is the most common type of parallel computer today.
