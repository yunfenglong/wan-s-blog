## Overview

Resetting Hadoop HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) is a critical operation that system administrators may need to perform in various scenarios. Whether you're recovering from a system failure, troubleshooting data corruption issues, or preparing a clean environment for testing, understanding how to safely reset HDFS is essential.

::: warning
HDFS reset operations involve data manipulation that could potentially lead to data loss if not performed correctly. Always ensure you have proper backups and understand the implications before proceeding.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before attempting any HDFS reset operation, ensure you have:

1. **Backup your data**: Always create backups of important data before performing reset operations
2. **Stop running services**: Stop all Hadoop services to prevent conflicts during the reset
3. **Check cluster status**: Verify the current health status of your HDFS cluster
4. **Document current configuration**: Save your current configuration files for reference

## Step-by-Step HDFS Reset Process

### Step 1: Stop Hadoop Services

```bash
# Stop all Hadoop services
stop-dfs.sh
stop-yarn.sh
mr-jobhistory-daemon.sh stop historyserver
```

::: steps
- Verify all services are stopped using `jps` command
- Check for any remaining processes and manually terminate if necessary
:::

### Step 2: Clear HDFS Data

```bash
# Format the HDFS filesystem
hdfs namenode -format

# Optional: Clear the data directories manually
rm -rf /var/hadoop/hdfs/namenode/*
rm -rf /var/hadoop/hdfs/datanode/*
rm -rf /tmp/hadoop-*
```

::: tip
Use `rm -rf` with caution as it permanently deletes files. Double-check the paths before execution.
:::

### Step 3: Recreate HDFS Directory Structure

```bash
# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p /var/hadoop/hdfs/namenode
mkdir -p /var/hadoop/hdfs/datanode
mkdir -p /tmp/hadoop-$(whoami)

# Set proper permissions
chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /var/hadoop/hdfs
chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /tmp/hadoop-$(whoami)
```

### Step 4: Restart Hadoop Services

```bash
# Format HDFS (if not already done)
hdfs namenode -format

# Start HDFS services
start-dfs.sh

# Start YARN services
start-yarn.sh

# Start HistoryServer
mr-jobhistory-daemon.sh start historyserver
```

::: steps
- Monitor the startup process for any errors
- Check service status using `jps`
- Verify HDFS is running properly using `hdfs dfsadmin -report`
:::

## Verification Steps

After completing the reset process, verify your HDFS cluster is functioning correctly:

```bash
# Check HDFS report
hdfs dfsadmin -report

# List root directory
hdfs dfs -ls /

# Test file operations
hdfs dfs -mkdir /test
hdfs dfs -put /etc/passwd /test/passwd
hdfs dfs -cat /test/passwd
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: NameNode Format Issues

::: warning
If you encounter "Incompatible filesystem" errors, you may need to perform a clean format:

```bash
# Stop services
stop-dfs.sh

# Clean directories
rm -rf /var/hadoop/hdfs/namenode/*
rm -rf /var/hadoop/hdfs/datanode/*

# Format and restart
hdfs namenode -format
start-dfs.sh
```
:::

### Issue 2: Permission Denied Errors

```bash
# Fix permissions
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /var/hadoop/hdfs
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /tmp/hadoop-*
```

### Issue 3: Datanode Registration Failed

```bash
# Remove datanode ID and restart
rm -rf /var/hadoop/hdfs/datanode/current
stop-dfs.sh
start-dfs.sh
```

## Backup and Recovery Strategies

### Creating Backups

```bash
# Backup HDFS configuration
cp -r /etc/hadoop ~/hadoop-config-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Backup important data from HDFS
hdfs dfs -cp /user/hadoop/input /user/hadoop/input-backup
```

### Recovery Procedures

```bash
# Restore configuration (if needed)
cp -r ~/hadoop-config-backup-*/hadoop /etc/

# Restore data (if backed up)
hdfs dfs -cp /user/hadoop/input-backup/* /user/hadoop/input/
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always backup first**: Never perform a reset without proper backups
2. **Test in staging**: Test reset procedures in a staging environment first
3. **Document everything**: Keep detailed records of all operations
4. **Monitor performance**: After reset, monitor cluster performance closely
5. **Update documentation**: Update your cluster documentation with any configuration changes

## Safety Considerations
*This guide provides a comprehensive approach to HDFS reset operations. Always adapt procedures to your specific environment and requirements.*

::: danger
⚠️ **WARNING**: HDFS reset operations are irreversible and will result in data loss if:
- You haven't backed up your data
- You execute commands on the wrong paths
- You skip verification steps

Always double-check:
- File paths before deletion
- Service status before operations
- Backup completeness before reset
