### Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

:::note Algorithm Complexity
**Time Complexity:** $O(F \cdot E)$ where $F$ is the maximum flow and $E$ is the number of edges
:::

```python
def ford_fulkerson(my_graph):
    # initialzie flow
    flow = 0
    # initialize the residual network
    residual_network = ResidualNetwork(my_graph)
    # as long s there is a augmenting path
    while residual_network.has_AugmentingPath():
        # take the path
        path = residual_network.get_AugmentingPath()
        # augment the flow equal to the residual capacity
        flow += path.residual_capacity
        # updating the residual network
        residual_network.augmentFlow(path)
    return flow
```

#### The Residual Network

Given a flow network, G = (V, E) and a flow f, the residual network G_f, essentially represents how much more flow can be sent through each edge.

:::tip Key Properties
- **Same vertices** as original network
- **Forward edge** / residual edge for ==remaining capacity==
- **Backward edge** / reversible edge for flow that can be ==cancelled==
- **Simple graph**, so multi edges are merged together
- Sum of the edges between 2 vertices same as the edge capacity
:::

#### Path Augmentation

:::important Augmenting Path
- A **traversal** in the residual network
  - from __source__ to __target__
- Following the edges in the residual network
:::

## Search Trees

:::info Tree Data Structures Overview
The following tree structures are commonly used in computer science:
:::

- **Binary Search Trees** - Basic ordered tree structure
- **AVL Trees** - Self-balancing BST with height balancing
- **2-3 Trees** - Multi-way search trees with 2 or 3 children
- **Red-Black Trees** - Self-balancing BST with color properties
- **Prefix Trie** - Tree for storing strings with common prefixes
- **Suffix Tree** - Compressed trie for all suffixes of a string
- **Suffix Array** - Space-efficient alternative to suffix trees
