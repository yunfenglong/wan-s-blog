## What is Inter-Process Communication (IPC)?

**Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** refers to all mechanisms that allow two or more processes to exchange messages and data. These mechanisms can be categorized based on their scope:

* **Local IPC**: Communication is restricted to processes running on the same host machine's operating system.
* **Networked IPC**: Communication is permitted between processes on different host machines connected via a network.


## Local IPC Mechanisms

IPC mechanisms restricted to a single host operating system typically include:

* **Shared Memory**: This method works by mapping shared pages of memory into the address space of two or more processes, allowing them to read and write to a common memory area. Shared memory is very fast but imposes no structure on the data being exchanged.
* **Message Passing**: Processes communicate by sending and receiving formatted messages.
* **Unix Signals (and analogues)**: A simple form of IPC where one process can send a signal (a notification) to another.

Unlike the free-form nature of shared memory, both Message Passing and Signals typically require messages to adhere to a discrete, predefined structure.


## Stream-Oriented IPC

Stream-oriented communication is one of the most common schemes used for both local and networked IPC.

### How It Works

A stream connection is unstructured, handling data as a **First-In, First-Out (FIFO)** sequence of bytes or characters. The stream typically arrives at the destination in the same order it was sent, making it behave like a transparent pipe from the perspective of an application protocol.

The two most widely used stream-oriented IPC mechanisms are **BSD Sockets** and **SVR4 STREAMS**, both of which are designed around standard Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These APIs are provided by **middleware**, which sits between the user application and the operating system's protocol stack (like TCP/UDP).

### Channel Properties

* **Reliability**: The communication channel is considered "reliable" when it connects two processes on a single host or across a network using the **TCP protocol**. It is "unreliable" when using the **UDP protocol** for networked communication.
* **Ordering**: Stream IPC connections almost always deliver messages "in order," behaving like a FIFO queue or pipe.
* **Behavior**: The interface can be either "blocking" or "non-blocking" depending on the API and its configuration, which determines whether a process must wait for a message transfer to complete.


### Performance Considerations

In parallel applications running on distributed platforms like clusters and clouds, IPC performance is a critical challenge. There are two primary metrics for performance:

* **Latency (Delay)**: The total time it takes for a message to travel from the sending process to the receiving process.
* **Throughput (Bandwidth)**: The volume of data that can be sent over a link per unit of time (e.g., Gigabits/second).

Even on high-bandwidth networks, latency can be significant, especially in applications with data dependencies where one process must wait for data from another before it can continue.

### Sources of Latency in Data Centers

In a typical data center, latency accumulates from several sources as a packet travels from a source node to a destination node:
1.  **Node Delays**: Delays within the source and destination nodes caused by the middleware and the operating system's protocol stack processing.
2.  **Router Delays**: Queuing and processing delays at each router the packet passes through in the network fabric.
3.  **Propagation Delays**: The physical time it takes for the signal to travel through the network cables, which is proportional to the total path length.
