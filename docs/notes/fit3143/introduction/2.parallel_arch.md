### **Flynn's Taxonomy: Classifying Parallel Architectures**

In 1966, Michael Flynn developed a widely used classification system for parallel computers based on the number of instruction and data streams a system can process.

* **SISD (Single Instruction, Single Data)**: This is a traditional, non-parallel serial computer. It has a single processor executing one instruction stream on one data stream. Most early computers and single-core PCs are examples of this model.
* **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**: In this model, a single instruction is executed by multiple processing units simultaneously, with each unit acting on a different piece of data. This architecture is highly efficient for tasks with a high degree of regularity, such as graphics or image processing.
* **MISD (Multiple Instruction, Single Data)**: This is the rarest class of parallel computer, where multiple instructions operate independently on a single stream of data. A potential application could involve using several different cryptographic algorithms to try and crack a single coded message.
* **MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data)**: This is the most common type of parallel computer today. Every processor can execute a different instruction stream on a different data stream. All modern multicore processors, supercomputers, and computer networks fall into this category.
