# FIT3080 - Artificial Intelligence

## Introduction

Welcome to my study notes for **FIT3080 - Artificial Intelligence**. This unit delves into the foundational principles of AI, exploring how to design and build intelligent agents that can perceive their environment, reason about their knowledge, and act to achieve goals.

From classic search algorithms to modern machine learning concepts, this course provides a comprehensive overview of the field. These notes are my attempt to structure and document my learning journey through this fascinating subject.

### What You'll Find Here

**Core Topics Covered:**
- **Foundations of AI**: The history, philosophy, and future of Artificial Intelligence.
- **Intelligent Agents**: Exploring different types of agents (simple reflex, model-based, goal-based, utility-based) and their environments.
- **Problem-Solving with Search**:
    - Uninformed search strategies (BFS, DFS, IDS).
    - Informed (Heuristic) search strategies (Greedy Best-First, A*).
    - Local search and optimization problems.
- **Adversarial Search**: Techniques for game-playing agents (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning).
- **Knowledge, Reasoning, and Planning**: How agents can represent knowledge and make logical deductions.
- **Uncertainty**: Handling incomplete or uncertain information with probability.
- **Machine Learning**: An introduction to how agents can learn from experience.

### Current Content

ðŸ“š **AI Basics**: Core concepts and an introduction to the field.

ðŸ“š **Intelligent Agents**: Detailed exploration of agent architectures and their design principles.

ðŸ“š **Search**: In-depth coverage of various search algorithms for problem-solving.

*More sections will be added as the unit progresses, including topics like logic, planning, and machine learning.*

### Skills You'll Develop

- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Designing and implementing complex search algorithms.
