### Question

This question is about the game Noughts-and-Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe). The game is played on a $3 \\times 3$ grid by two players, Crosses (X) and Noughts (O), who take turns placing their symbol in an empty cell. A player wins when they have three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. If all cells are occupied and no one has won, the game is a Draw.

The variable `P` always stands for a position in the game. The state of the game determines whose turn it is:

  * If the number of Crosses equals the number of Noughts, it is Crosses' turn.
  * If the number of Crosses is one more than the number of Noughts, it is Noughts' turn.

A *winning move* is a move by a player that immediately wins the game.

We use the following variables, predicates, and function:

  * `CrossesWins(P)`: True if, in position P, there is a line of three Crosses and no line of three Noughts.
  * `NoughtsWins(P)`: True if, in position P, there is a line of three Noughts and no line of three Crosses.
  * `CrossesToMove(P)`: True if it is Crosses' turn to move in position P.
  * `NoughtsToMove(P)`: True if it is Noughts' turn to move in position P.
  * `ResultingPosition(P, M)`: A function that returns the position produced by starting with position P and then playing move M. A move M is specified by the player and the cell.

-----

Using quantifiers and the variables, predicates, and function described above, write statements in predicate logic with each of the following meanings.

**(a)** Crosses has a winning move in position P.

**(b)** Noughts has a winning move in position P.

**(c)** For each of the statements you wrote for (a) and (b), determine whether the statement is True or False when P is the following position:

```
  X O
X X O
O
```

**(d)** A *losing move* is a move that gives the opponent an immediate win. In Noughts-and-Crosses, this never happens. Write a predicate logic statement to say that losing moves are impossible.

**(e)** Crosses has a strategy for winning within three moves from position P (where the three moves are one by Crosses, one by Noughts, and another by Crosses).

**(f)** Crosses does not have a strategy for winning within three moves from position P. For this question, you must ensure that no logical negation occurs immediately in front of any quantifier.

**(g)** Crosses has a winning strategy from the initial position $P\_0$ (an empty grid).

**(h)** Noughts has a winning strategy from the initial position $P\_0$.

**(i)** With best possible play from both sides from the initial position $P\_0$, the game ends in a Draw.

**(j)** It is possible for Noughts to win from the initial position $P\_0$.

### Answer

**(a)** A logical statement for "Crosses has a winning move in position P" is:
$$\text{CrossesToMove}(P) \wedge \exists M (\text{CrossesWins}(\text{ResultingPosition}(P, M)))$$

**(b)** A logical statement for "Noughts has a winning move in position P" is:
$$\text{NoughtsToMove}(P) \wedge \exists M (\text{NoughtsWins}(\text{ResultingPosition}(P, M)))$$

**(c)** For the position `P`:

```
  X O
X X O
O
```

In this position, there are 4 Crosses and 3 Noughts. According to the rules, "if the number of Crosses is one greater than the number of Noughts... the next player to move must be Noughts". Therefore, `NoughtsToMove(P)` is True.

  * The statement from **(a)** is **False**. Its first part, `CrossesToMove(P)`, is false.
  * The statement from **(b)** is **True**. It is Noughts' turn (`NoughtsToMove(P)` is True), and a move `M` exists (placing an O in the bottom-right cell) that makes `NoughtsWins(ResultingPosition(P, M))` true.

**(d)** A logical statement for "losing moves are impossible" is:
$$\forall P \forall M ( (\text{CrossesToMove}(P) \wedge \text{NoughtsWins}(\text{ResultingPosition}(P, M))) \rightarrow \text{NoughtsWins}(P) ) \\ \wedge ( (\text{NoughtsToMove}(P) \wedge \text{CrossesWins}(\text{ResultingPosition}(P, M))) \rightarrow \text{CrossesWins}(P) )$$
This means that if a player's move results in a win for the opponent, the opponent must have already won in the position *before* the move was made.

**(e)** Crosses has a strategy for winning within three moves from P:
$$\text{CrossesToMove}(P) \wedge \exists M_{C1} \forall M_{N1} \exists M_{C2} (\text{CrossesWins}(\text{ResultingPosition}(P, M_{C1}, M_{N1}, M_{C2})))$$

**(f)** Crosses does not have a strategy for winning within three moves from P:
$$\text{CrossesToMove}(P) \rightarrow \forall M_{C1} \exists M_{N1} \forall M_{C2} (\neg\text{CrossesWins}(\text{ResultingPosition}(P, M_{C1}, M_{N1}, M_{C2})))$$

**(g)** Crosses has a winning strategy from the initial position $P\_0$. This means Crosses can force a win regardless of how Noughts plays. It can be expressed as a disjunction of winning at each possible opportunity:
$$\exists M_1 \forall M_2 \exists M_3 \forall M_4 \exists M_5 (\text{CrossesWins}(\dots)) \lor \dots \lor \exists M_1 \dots \exists M_9 (\text{CrossesWins}(\dots))$$

**(h)** Noughts has a winning strategy from the initial position $P\_0$:
$$\forall M_1 \exists M_2 \forall M_3 \exists M_4 (\text{NoughtsWins}(\dots)) \lor \dots \lor \forall M_1 \dots \forall M_7 \exists M_8 (\text{NoughtsWins}(\dots))$$

**(i)** With best play, the game is a draw. This means neither player has a winning strategy.
$$\neg(\text{Statement from (g)}) \wedge \neg(\text{Statement from (h)})$$

**(j)** It is possible for Noughts to win from the initial position $P\_0$. This means there exists at least one sequence of moves (implying Crosses does not play optimally) that leads to a Noughts win.
$$\exists M_1 \exists M_2 \exists M_3 \exists M_4 (\text{NoughtsWins}(\dots)) \lor \dots \lor \exists M_1 \dots \exists M_8 (\text{NoughtsWins}(\dots))$$
