## Languages

- **Alphabet ($\Sigma$)**: A finite, non-empty set of symbols.
    - *Example*: $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$
- **Word**: A finite string of symbols from an alphabet.
- **Empty Word ($\epsilon$)**: The unique word with zero symbols.
- **Empty Set ($\emptyset$)**: The set with no elements.
- **$\Sigma^*$**: The set of all possible words that can be formed from the alphabet $\Sigma$, including the empty word $\epsilon$.

### Key Language Examples

- **EVEN-EVEN**: The language where each string has an even number of 'a's and an even number of 'b's.
    - Note: Since 0 is an even number, the empty word $\epsilon$ is in EVEN-EVEN.
- **DOUBLEWORD**: The language of words formed by concatenating some word $w$ with itself.
    - Formally: $\{ww \mid w \in \Sigma^*\}$.
    - Note: $\epsilon = \epsilon\epsilon$, so $\epsilon$ is a doubleword.
- **PALINDROMES**: The language of words that read the same forwards and backwards.
    - Formally: $\{w \mid w = w^R\}$, where $w^R$ is the reverse of $w$.
- **ODD-ODD**: The language where each string has an odd number of 'a's and an odd number of 'b's.
    - *Example*: The word `"a"` is **not** in ODD-ODD. It has 1 'a' (odd) but 0 'b's (even). The word `"abb"` is also not in ODD-ODD (1 'a', 2 'b's). The word `"ab"` is in ODD-ODD.

## Definitions, theorems, and proofs

**Theorem**: `DOUBLEWORD âŠ† EVEN-EVEN` (Every doubleword is also an even-even word).

**Proof**: Let $w$ be any word in $\Sigma^*$. Let the number of 'a's in $w$ be $n_a$ and the number of 'b's be $n_b$. The corresponding word in `DOUBLEWORD` is $ww$. The number of 'a's in $ww$ is $2n_a$ and the number of 'b's is $2n_b$. By definition, $2n_a$ and $2n_b$ are always even numbers. Therefore, any word in `DOUBLEWORD` is also in `EVEN-EVEN`. 

## Normal Forms

- **Literal**: A propositional variable or its negation (e.g., $A$ or $\neg A$).
- **Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)**: A disjunction (OR) of one or more clauses, where each clause is a conjunction (AND) of literals.
    - *Structure*: $(A \land \neg B) \lor (C \land D) \lor \dots$
- **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)**: A conjunction (AND) of one or more clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals.
    - *Structure*: $(A \lor \neg B) \land (C \lor D) \land \dots$

## Statements with variables

The variables in the statement are free, which means they have not been assign any values.

## Predicates definitions and terminology

- **Predicate**: A statement with variables that becomes a proposition once the variables are given specific values from a domain. A predicate is called l-ary if it has k arguments.
    - *Example*: $P(x) = "x > 10"$. $P(12)$ is True, $P(5)$ is False.
- **Universal Quantifier ($\forall$)**: Means **"for all"**. $\forall x, P(x)$ asserts that $P(x)$ is true for *every* $x$ in the domain.
- **Existential Quantifier ($\exists$)**: Means **"there exists"**. $\exists x, P(x)$ asserts that there is *at least one* $x$ in the domain for which $P(x)$ is true.

## Propositions and logical operations

- **Proposition**: A declarative sentence that is definitively **True** or **False**, but not both.
    - *Paradox*: "This statement is false" is a paradox, not a proposition, because its truth value cannot be determined without contradiction.
- **Tautology**: A statement that is always true, no matter the truth values of its variables (e.g., $p \lor \neg p$).
- **Logical Equivalence ($\equiv$)**: Two statements are logically equivalent if they always have the same truth value.
    - *Example*: De Morgan's Law states $\neg(p \land q) \equiv (\neg p \lor \neg q)$.
