Discovering proofs is an art as well as a science. It requires:

::: flex center

- skill at logical thinking and reasoning
- understanding the objects you're working with
- practice and experience

:::

## General Proof Strategies

:::: field-group

::: field name="Set Equality" type="theorem"
To prove set equality, A = B (where A and B are sets):

1. Prove A ⊆ B (every element of A is in B)
2. Prove B ⊆ A (every element of B is in A)
:::

::: field name="Numerical Equality" type="theorem"
To prove numerical equality, A = B:

- If algebra can transform A to B, that's sufficient
- If not:
  1. Prove A ≤ B
  2. Prove A ≥ B

## Proof Techniques in FIT2014

::: timeline

- Direct Proof
  time='' type=success

  **Strategy**: Start with assumptions and use logical deductions to reach the conclusion.

  **Example**: Prove that DOUBLEWORD ⊆ EVEN-EVEN
  - Let w be any word in Σ*
  - Let ww be the corresponding doubleword
  - If w has nₐ 'a's and nᵦ 'b's, then ww has 2nₐ 'a's and 2nᵦ 'b's
  - Since 2nₐ and 2nᵦ are even, ww ∈ EVEN-EVEN ✓

- Proof by Construction
  time='' type=info

  **Strategy**: When proving existence, construct an explicit example.

  **Use Case**: Proving that a language contains certain words or that a property holds.

- Proof by Cases
  time='' type=warning

  **Strategy**: Identify a finite number of cases that cover all possibilities.

  **Example**: Proving properties about languages based on word length or symbol counts.

- Proof by Contradiction
  time='' type=danger

  **Strategy**: Assume the negation of what you want to prove and derive a contradiction.

  **Example**: Proving that √2 is irrational (classic example covered in lectures).

- Mathematical Induction
  time='' type=important

  **Strategy**: Prove base case, then show if true for k, then true for k+1.

  **Structure**:
  1. **Base Case**: Prove S(1) is true
  2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume S(k) is true  
  3. **Inductive Step**: Show S(k) → S(k+1)

  **Application**: Prove that 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

## Language-Specific Proof Techniques

### Proving Language Properties

::: steps

1. **Language Equality**: L₁ = L₂
   - Prove L₁ ⊆ L₂ and L₂ ⊆ L₁

2. **Language Subset**: L₁ ⊆ L₂
   - Take arbitrary w ∈ L₁, show w ∈ L₂

3. **Language Operations**: Properties of union, intersection, concatenation

:::

### Example: Even-Odd Language Properties

::: card title="Theorem" icon="heroicons:academic-cap-solid"
Words in ODD-ODD have odd length.

**Proof**: Let w ∈ ODD-ODD with nₐ 'a's and nᵦ 'b's.
- By definition, nₐ is odd and nᵦ is odd
- Length of w = nₐ + nᵦ
- Sum of two odd numbers is even
- Therefore, all words in ODD-ODD have even length ✓

## Predicate Logic Proofs

### Working with Quantifiers

:::: field-group

::: field name="Universal (∀)" type="logic"
Must hold for ALL elements in domain

**Strategy**: Take arbitrary element from domain
:::

::: field name="Existential (∃)" type="logic"
Must hold for AT LEAST ONE element

**Strategy**: Construct specific example
:::

::::

### Example: Proving Universal Statements

::: demo-wrapper title="Universal Statement Proof"

**Theorem**: ∀w ∈ Σ*, if w ∈ EVEN-EVEN then |w| is even

**Proof**: Let w be an arbitrary word in EVEN-EVEN
- w has even number of 'a's and even number of 'b's
- Let nₐ = 2k, nᵦ = 2m for integers k, m
- |w| = nₐ + nᵦ = 2k + 2m = 2(k + m)
- Since k + m is integer, |w| is even ✓

## Proof Organization and Structure

### Standard Proof Format

::: steps

1. **Statement**: Clearly state what you're proving
2. **Approach**: Indicate the proof method (direct, contradiction, etc.)
3. **Body**: Step-by-step logical reasoning
4. **Conclusion**: State what has been proven

### Common FIT2014 Proof Patterns

:::: card-grid

::: card title="Automata Equivalence" icon="carbon:compare"
Show two machines accept same language
:::

::: card title="Language Regularity" icon="carbon:rule"
Prove a language is/isn't regular
:::

::: card title="Grammar Properties" icon="carbon:tree-view"
Show properties of context-free grammars
:::

::: card title="Pumping Lemma" icon="carbon:arrows-vertical"
Prove languages are not regular/context-free
:::

## Practice Exercises

::: collapse

- **Set Theory**: Prove that (A ∩ B) ∪ C = (A ∪ C) ∩ (B ∪ C)

- **Language Properties**: Prove that if w ∈ PALINDROMES, then wᴿ ∈ PALINDROMES

- **Induction**: Prove by induction that the sum of first n odd numbers is n²

- **Contradiction**: Prove that there is no largest prime number

- **Quantifiers**: Prove ∃w ∈ Σ* such that w ∈ EVEN-EVEN and |w| > 0

- **Language Operations**: Prove that L₁ ∩ L₂ ⊆ L₁ for any languages L₁, L₂

- **Direct Proof**: Prove that if n is even, then n³ is even
