Discovering proofs is an art as well as a science. It requires:

::: flex center

- skill at logical thinking and reasoning
- understanding the objects you're working with
- practice and experience

:::

## General Proof Strategies

:::: field-group

::: field name="Set Equality" type="theorem"
To prove set equality, A = B (where A and B are sets):

1. Prove $A \subseteq B$ (every element of A is in B)
2. Prove $B \subseteq A$ (every element of B is in A)
:::

::: field name="Numerical Equality" type="theorem"
To prove numerical equality, A = B:

- If algebra can transform A to B, that's sufficient
- If not:
  1. Prove $A \leq B$
2. Prove $A \geq B$

## Proof Techniques in FIT2014

::: timeline

- Direct Proof
  time='' type=success

  **Strategy**: Start with assumptions and use logical deductions to reach the conclusion.

  **Example**: Prove that DOUBLEWORD $\subseteq$ EVEN-EVEN
  - Let w be any word in $\Sigma^*$
  - Let ww be the corresponding doubleword
  - If w has $n_a$ 'a's and $n_b$ 'b's, then ww has $2n_a$ 'a's and $2n_b$ 'b's
  - Since $2n_a$ and $2n_b$ are even, $ww \in$ EVEN-EVEN ✓

- Proof by Construction
  time='' type=info

  **Strategy**: When proving existence, construct an explicit example.

  **Use Case**: Proving that a language contains certain words or that a property holds.

- Proof by Cases
  time='' type=warning

  **Strategy**: Identify a finite number of cases that cover all possibilities.

  **Example**: Proving properties about languages based on word length or symbol counts.

- Proof by Contradiction
  time='' type=danger

  **Strategy**: Assume the negation of what you want to prove and derive a contradiction.

  **Example**: Proving that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational (classic example covered in lectures).

- Mathematical Induction
  time='' type=important

  **Strategy**: Prove base case, then show if true for k, then true for k+1.

  **Structure**:
  1. **Base Case**: Prove S(1) is true
  2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume S(k) is true  
  3. **Inductive Step**: Show $S(k) \to S(k+1)$

  **Application**: Prove that 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

## Language-Specific Proof Techniques

### Proving Language Properties

::: steps

1. **Language Equality**: L₁ = L₂
   - Prove $L_1 \subseteq L_2$ and $L_2 \subseteq L_1$

2. **Language Subset**: $L_1 \subseteq L_2$
- Take arbitrary $w \in L_1$, show $w \in L_2$

3. **Language Operations**: Properties of union, intersection, concatenation

:::

### Example: Even-Odd Language Properties

::: card title="Theorem" icon="heroicons:academic-cap-solid"
Words in ODD-ODD have odd length.

**Proof**: Let $w \in$ ODD-ODD with $n_a$ 'a's and $n_b$ 'b's.
- By definition, $n_a$ is odd and $n_b$ is odd
- Length of $w = n_a + n_b$
- Sum of two odd numbers is even
- Therefore, all words in ODD-ODD have even length ✓
:::

## Predicate Logic Proofs

### Working with Quantifiers

:::: field-group

::: field name="Universal ($\forall$)" type="logic"
Must hold for ALL elements in domain

**Strategy**: Take arbitrary element from domain
:::

::: field name="Existential ($\exists$)" type="logic"
Must hold for AT LEAST ONE element

**Strategy**: Construct specific example
:::

::::

### Example: Proving Universal Statements

::: demo-wrapper title="Universal Statement Proof"

**Theorem**: $\forall w \in \Sigma^*$, if $w \in$ EVEN-EVEN then $|w|$ is even

**Proof**: Let w be an arbitrary word in EVEN-EVEN
- w has even number of 'a's and even number of 'b's
- Let $n_a = 2k$, $n_b = 2m$ for integers k, m
- $|w| = n_a + n_b = 2k + 2m = 2(k + m)$
- Since k + m is integer, |w| is even ✓

## Proof Organization and Structure

### Standard Proof Format

::: steps

1. **Statement**: Clearly state what you're proving
2. **Approach**: Indicate the proof method (direct, contradiction, etc.)
3. **Body**: Step-by-step logical reasoning
4. **Conclusion**: State what has been proven

### Common FIT2014 Proof Patterns

:::: card-grid

::: card title="Automata Equivalence" icon="carbon:compare"
Show two machines accept same language
:::

::: card title="Language Regularity" icon="carbon:rule"
Prove a language is/isn't regular
:::

::: card title="Grammar Properties" icon="carbon:tree-view"
Show properties of context-free grammars
:::

::: card title="Pumping Lemma" icon="carbon:arrows-vertical"
Prove languages are not regular/context-free
:::

## Practice Exercises

::: collapse

- **Set Theory**: Prove that $(A \cap B) \cup C = (A \cup C) \cap (B \cup C)$

  Start with set equality proof strategy: prove both directions of inclusion.

- **Language Properties**: Prove that if $w \in$ PALINDROMES, then $w^R \in$ PALINDROMES

  Use the definition of palindromes and properties of string reversal.

- **Induction**: Prove by induction that the sum of first n odd numbers is n²

  Base case: n=1, then use inductive step with algebraic manipulation.

- **Contradiction**: Prove that there is no largest prime number

  Assume there exists a largest prime, then construct a larger one.

- **Quantifiers**: Prove $\exists w \in \Sigma^*$ such that $w \in$ EVEN-EVEN and $|w| > 0$

  Construct an explicit example word with even counts of all symbols.

- **Language Operations**: Prove that $L_1 \cap L_2 \subseteq L_1$ for any languages $L_1, L_2$

  Use the definition of set intersection and subset relations.

- **Direct Proof**: Prove that if n is even, then n³ is even

  Use the definition of even numbers and properties of multiplication.
