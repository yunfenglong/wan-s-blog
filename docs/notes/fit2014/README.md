# FIT2014 - Theory of Computation

## Introduction

Welcome to my comprehensive notes on **Theory of Computation**! This fascinating unit explores the fundamental boundaries of what can be computed and how efficiently we can solve problems.

Throughout this course, we'll dive deep into the mathematical foundations that define the very essence of computation. From the simplest pattern-matching algorithms to the most complex computational problems, we'll discover what makes computation possibleâ€”and what makes some problems inherently difficult or even impossible to solve.

### What You'll Find Here

**Core Topics Covered:**
- **Formal Languages & Models**: Understanding how we describe and classify different types of computational problems
- **Automata Theory**: Finite state machines, pushdown automata, and their practical applications
- **Regular Expressions & Grammars**: The building blocks of pattern recognition and language processing
- **Turing Machines**: The theoretical foundation of all modern computers
- **Computational Complexity**: Exploring the boundaries between tractable and intractable problems
- **P vs NP Problem**: One of the most important unsolved problems in computer science
- **NP-Completeness**: Understanding the hardest problems in NP and their implications

### Current Content

ðŸ“š **Languages** - Detailed exploration of formal language theory and classification

*More sections will be added as the course progresses, including practical examples, proof techniques, and problem-solving strategies.*

### Skills You'll Develop
