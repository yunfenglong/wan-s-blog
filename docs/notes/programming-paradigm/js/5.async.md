This page details the mechanisms JavaScript uses to handle non-blocking operations, from the event loop to modern `async/await`.

::: timeline horizontal

  - **Callbacks**
    time=The Past
    
    The original pattern for async operations. Prone to "Callback Hell" (deeply nested callbacks) which is hard to read and maintain.

  - **Promises**
    time=The Present
    
    An object representing the future result of an async operation. It formalizes the process with `.then()` for success and `.catch()` for errors, enabling clean chaining.

  - **`async/await`**
    time=The Future
    
    Syntactic sugar over Promises that allows writing async code that looks synchronous, dramatically improving readability and error handling with `try...catch`.

1.  **Understanding the Event Loop**
    JavaScript's concurrency model is based on the event loop.

    1.  **Execution**: Code is run on the **Call Stack**.
    2.  **Offloading**: When an async operation (e.g., `fetch`, `setTimeout`) is called, it's handed off to the browser/Node.js API to run in the background. The Call Stack is now free.
    3.  **Queuing**: Once the background API finishes, it places its callback function into a queue. Promises place their callbacks in the **Microtask Queue**, while others use the **Callback (or Macrotask) Queue**.
    4.  **Looping**: The **Event Loop** constantly checks if the Call Stack is empty.
    5.  **Prioritizing**: If the stack is empty, the Event Loop first processes *all* tasks in the Microtask Queue before moving to a *single* task from the Callback Queue. This is why Promises resolve before `setTimeout` callbacks.

2.  **Mastering Promises**
    Beyond simple `.then()` and `.catch()`, mastering promises involves understanding chaining and combinators.

    **Chaining and Value Passing**:
    Whatever you `return` from a `.then()` callback becomes the value passed to the *next* `.then()` in the chain. If you return a new Promise, the chain will wait for that new Promise to resolve.

    ```javascript
    Promise.resolve(10)
      .then(value => value * 2) // returns 20
      .then(value => {
        console.log(value); // 20
        return Promise.resolve(value + 5); // returns a new promise
      })
      .then(value => console.log(value)); // 25
    ```

    **Promise Combinators**:

      * `Promise.all(iterable)`: Great for running multiple independent async operations in parallel. It waits for all to succeed; fails if any one fails.
      * `Promise.allSettled(iterable)`: Use when you need to know the outcome of every promise, regardless of whether they succeed or fail.
      * `Promise.race(iterable)`: Useful for scenarios with a timeout, where you race a data promise against a `setTimeout` promise.
      * `Promise.any(iterable)`: Good for fetching a resource from multiple endpoints, succeeding as soon as the first one responds.

3.  **Advanced `async/await` Patterns**
    While `await` makes code look synchronous, it's important to avoid creating unnecessary waterfalls.

    **Sequential vs. Parallel Execution**:

    ```javascript
    // BAD: Sequential waterfall - each await waits for the previous one
    async function getSequentialData() {
      const user = await fetchUser();
      const posts = await fetchPosts(); // Waits for fetchUser to complete
      return { user, posts };
    }

    // GOOD: Parallel execution - requests start concurrently
    async function getParallelData() {
      const userPromise = fetchUser();
      const postsPromise = fetchPosts();
      // Promise.all waits for both to complete
      const [user, posts] = await Promise.all([userPromise, postsPromise]);
      return { user, posts };
    }
    ```
