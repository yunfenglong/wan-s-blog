This section dissects the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript, focusing on the nuances of scope, types, coercion, and operators that are critical for writing professional-grade code.

## **Variables, Scope, and the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**
JavaScript's variable scoping has evolved significantly. Understanding the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` is crucial.

**`var`**:

* **Scope**: Function-scoped. A `var` declared inside a function is available anywhere in that function. If declared outside any function, it becomes a global variable.
* **Hoisting**: `var` declarations are "hoisted" to the top of their scope, but their assignments are not. This means you can reference a `var` before its declaration without a `ReferenceError`, but its value will be `undefined`.

<!-- end list -->

```javascript
function checkVar() {
    console.log(myVar); // Outputs: undefined
    var myVar = "I am hoisted";
    console.log(myVar); // Outputs: "I am hoisted"
}
```

**`let` and `const`**:

Scope: 
* Block-scoped. They are only accessible within the `{}` block they are defined in (e.g., inside an `if` statement, `for` loop, or a standalone block).

Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ): 
* `let` and `const` are also hoisted, but they are not initialized. The period from the start of the block until the declaration is reached is the TDZ. Accessing a variable in its TDZ results in a `ReferenceError`. This prevents bugs caused by using a variable before it's declared.

Immutability: 
* `const` creates an immutable *binding*. For primitive types, this means the value cannot change. For objects and arrays, the reference cannot be changed, but the contents of the object or array *can* be modified.

## **Types, Coercion, and Equality Deep Dive**
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, but its type system has important rules.

:::: field-group
::: field name="Primitives vs. Reference Types"

* **Primitives**: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint`. They are passed by *value*. When you assign a primitive to another variable, a copy is made.
* **Reference Types**: `object` (which includes `array`, `function`, etc.). They are passed by *reference*. When you assign an object to another variable, both variables point to the *same* location in memory.

::: field name="Implicit vs. Explicit Coercion"

* **Implicit Coercion**: JavaScript automatically converts types in certain operations (e.g., `5 + '5'` results in the string `'55'`). This is often the source of bugs. The `==` operator is a prime example.
* **Explicit Coercion**: Manually converting a type using functions like `Number()`, `String()`, or `Boolean()`. This is considered a best practice for predictable code.

<!-- end list -->

```javascript
const numString = "123";
const num = Number(numString); // Explicitly convert string to number
```

:::

::: field name="`null` vs. `undefined`"

* `undefined` typically means a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
* `null` is an explicit assignment value that means "no value." It is intentionally set by the developer.
* A key quirk: `typeof undefined` is `"undefined"`, but `typeof null` is `"object"`. This is a long-standing bug in the language.

## **Modern Operators and Advanced Logic**
Modern JavaScript provides powerful operators for writing more concise and safe code.

**Logical Operator Short-Circuiting**:

* `||` (OR): Evaluates expressions from left to right and returns the *first truthy value* it finds. If no truthy value is found, it returns the last falsy value. It stops as soon as it finds a truthy value.
* `&&` (AND): Evaluates from left to right and returns the *first falsy value* it finds. If all values are truthy, it returns the last truthy value. It stops as soon as it finds a falsy value.

<!-- end list -->

```javascript
// Use case: setting a default value (pre-ES2020)
const name = providedName || "Guest";

// Use case: conditionally calling a function
user.isLoggedIn && user.logOut(); // logOut() only called if isLoggedIn is true
```

**Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`)**:
This is a safer alternative to `||` for setting defaults. It only returns the right-hand side value if the left-hand side is `null` or `undefined`, ignoring other falsy values like `0`, `''`, or `false`.

**Optional Chaining (`?.`)**:
Prevents errors when trying to access properties of a potentially `null` or `undefined` object. If any part of the chain is `null` or `undefined`, the expression short-circuits and returns `undefined`.

```javascript
const user = { getProfile: () => ({ name: "Alex" }) };

// Safely access a nested property
const street = user.address?.street; // undefined

// Safely call a function that might not exist
const data = user.getData?.(); // undefined
```
