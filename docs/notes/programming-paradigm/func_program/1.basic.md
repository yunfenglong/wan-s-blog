::: note
Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm built around the concept of ==composable functions== as the primary unit of composition. Rather than focusing on objects and the state they contain, FP treats programming as a process of data ==transformation==, where functions act as the "verbs" that drive the computation.

### Core Concepts of Functional Programming

Functional programming is defined by a few key principles that differentiate it from other paradigms like Object-Oriented programming.

Functional programming focuses on functions as *transformations* of data. This approach is often described as a "Kingdom of Verbs," where the primary focus is on the actions (functions) rather than the static data structures ("nouns").

::: card title="Purity and Immutability" icon="mdi:shield-check-outline"
FP adheres closely to the mathematical definition of a function. This means functions should be *pure*â€”their only result is an explicit return value, and they have no hidden *side effects* (like modifying external state). As part of this, FP favors treating data as immutable.

::: card title="Declarative Style" icon="mdi:lightbulb-on-outline"
Pure functional programs tend to be more declarative, focusing on ==what== the solution is rather than ==how== to compute it step-by-step. The manipulation of state is made explicit through function parameters and return types instead of being hidden in side effects.

::: card title="Higher-Order Functions" icon="mdi:function-variant"
A central feature of FP is the support for *higher-order functions*. These are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return new functions as their result, enabling powerful patterns of abstraction and composition.

### The Foundation: Lambda Calculus

::: card title="Model of Computation" icon="mdi:calculator-variant-outline"
The functional paradigm is not based on the underlying machine architecture but on a different model of computation entirely: the **Lambda Calculus**. Developed in the 1930s, this model is based on mathematical functions, their application, and their composition.

### Key Characteristics of Functional Programming

The principles of FP lead to a distinct set of characteristics, especially when compared to the Object-Oriented paradigm.

:::: field-group
::: field name="State Management" type="Immutable"
FP treats objects as immutable. Instead of mutating an object's state, a function returns a new object with the updated state.
:::

::: field name="Data and Behaviour" type="Loosely Coupled"
Data and the functions that operate on it are loosely coupled. This is achieved through pure, generic functions that are not tied to a specific object's internal state.
:::

::: field name="Control Flow" type="Function-based"
Control flow is managed through function calls, recursion, and the chaining of functions, rather than traditional loops and conditionals.
:::

::: field name="Thread Safety" type="Concurrent by Nature"
Because pure functions do not modify external state, they are easily and safely used in concurrent or parallel computations without the risk of race conditions.

::: tip Modern Functional Programming
Historically, Functional and Object-Oriented programming were seen as competing paradigms. However, they are now viewed as complementary. Many modern languages, including TypeScript, Scala, C++17, Java (8+), Swift, Rust, and Python 3, provide facilities for both, allowing programmers to use functional concepts to write more robust and maintainable code.
