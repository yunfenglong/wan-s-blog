# Programming Paradigm

::: note
This comprehensive guide explores the fundamental programming paradigms that shape how we think about and write code. Understanding these paradigms is essential for becoming a versatile programmer who can choose the right approach for different problems.

## **Overview of Programming Paradigms**

Programming paradigms are fundamental styles or approaches to programming that provide a framework for thinking about and solving problems. Each paradigm offers different ways to structure code, manage data, and handle program execution.

### **Major Programming Paradigms**

1. **[Imperative Programming](#imperative-programming)** - Focus on how to achieve results
2. **[Object-Oriented Programming](#object-oriented-programming)** - Organize code around objects
3. **[Functional Programming](#functional-programming)** - Treat computation as function evaluation
4. **[Declarative Programming](#declarative-programming)** - Focus on what to achieve
5. **[Logic Programming](#logic-programming)** - Based on formal logic

## **Imperative Programming**

Imperative programming focuses on describing **HOW** to achieve a result through step-by-step instructions that change the program's state.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Sequence of commands** that modify state
- **Variables and assignment** to store and update data
- **Control structures** (loops, conditionals) for flow control
- **Explicit state management**

### **Example**
```python
# Imperative approach - calculate sum of squares
def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    total = 0  # Initialize state
    for num in numbers:
        square = num * num  # Calculate square
        total += square     # Update state
    return total

# Usage
result = sum_of_squares([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(result)  # 55
```

### **Languages**
- C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, PHP

## **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

Object-oriented programming organizes code around **objects** that contain data and behavior. It emphasizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### **Key Principles**
- **Encapsulation**: Bundle data and methods together
- **Inheritance**: Create new classes based on existing ones
- **Polymorphism**: Objects of different types can be treated uniformly
- **Abstraction**: Hide complex implementation details

### **Example**
```python
# Object-oriented approach
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
    
    def make_sound(self):
        pass  # Abstract method
    
    def introduce(self):
        return f"I am {self.name}, a {self.species}"

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Usage
animals = [Dog("Buddy", "dog"), Cat("Whiskers", "cat")]
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.introduce())
    print(animal.make_sound())
```

### **Languages**
- Java, C++, Python, C#, Ruby, JavaScript

## **Functional Programming**

Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of **mathematical functions** and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Pure functions**: Same input always produces same output
- **Immutability**: Data cannot be changed after creation
- **First-class functions**: Functions can be assigned to variables
- **Higher-order functions**: Functions can take and return other functions
- **Recursion**: Preferred over loops for iteration

### **Example**
```python
# Functional approach - sum of squares
def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    return sum(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))

# Alternative with list comprehension
def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    return sum([x ** 2 for x in numbers])

# Pure function composition
def compose(f, g):
    return lambda x: f(g(x))

# Usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum_of_squares(numbers)
print(result)  # 55
```

### **Languages**
- Haskell, Lisp, Clojure, Scala, F#, Elm

## **Declarative Programming**

Declarative programming focuses on **WHAT** you want to achieve rather than **HOW** to achieve it. You describe the desired result, and the system figures out how to get there.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Describes desired outcome** rather than implementation
- **No explicit control flow**
- **High-level abstraction**
- **Often uses constraints or rules**

### **Example**
```sql
-- SQL is declarative
SELECT name, age, department
FROM employees
WHERE age > 25 AND department = 'Engineering'
ORDER BY name;
```

```python
# Declarative approach with list comprehension
even_squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
# Result: [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
```

### **Languages and Domains**
- SQL (database queries)
- HTML/CSS (web styling)
- Prolog (logic programming)
- Configuration files (YAML, JSON)

## **Logic Programming**

Logic programming is based on **formal logic** where programs are expressed as a set of logical statements and rules.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Facts and rules** as the foundation
- **Pattern matching** and unification
- **Backtracking** to find solutions
- **Declarative nature** with logical inference

### **Example**
```prolog
% Facts
parent(john, mary).
parent(mary, susan).
parent(mary, tom).

% Rules
grandparent(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), parent(Y, Z).

% Query
?- grandparent(john, susan).
% Yes

?- grandparent(john, Who).
% Who = susan ;
% Who = tom
```

### **Languages**
- Prolog, Datalog, Answer Set Programming (ASP)

## **Multi-Paradigm Programming**

Most modern languages support **multiple paradigms**, allowing developers to choose the best approach for each problem.

### **Example: JavaScript**
```javascript
// Imperative style
function sumImperative(numbers) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        total += numbers[i];
    }
    return total;
}

// Functional style
const sumFunctional = numbers => numbers.reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0);

// Object-oriented style
class Calculator {
    sum(numbers) {
        return numbers.reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0);
    }
}

// Declarative style (with array methods)
const sumDeclarative = numbers => numbers.filter(n => n > 0).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
```

### **Multi-Paradigm Languages**
- Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, C#, Rust, Swift

## **Paradigm Comparison**

| Paradigm | Focus | State Management | Key Strength | Common Use Cases |
|----------|-------|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Imperative** | How to do it | Mutable state | Direct control | System programming, algorithms |
| **OOP** | Objects and behavior | Encapsulated state | Modeling complex systems | GUI applications, business logic |
| **Functional** | Function evaluation | Immutable data | Predictability, testing | Data processing, concurrent systems |
| **Declarative** | What to achieve | Implicit state | Simplicity, expressiveness | Database queries, configuration |
| **Logic** | Logical relationships | Logical constraints | Problem solving | AI, expert systems, parsing |

## **Choosing the Right Paradigm**

### **Considerations for Choosing**

1. **Problem Domain**
   - **Business applications**: OOP for modeling entities
   - **Data processing**: Functional for transformations
   - **System programming**: Imperative for low-level control
   - **Database operations**: Declarative for queries

2. **Team Expertise**
   - Choose paradigms your team understands well
   - Consider learning curve for new approaches

3. **Performance Requirements**
   - Some paradigms have different performance characteristics
   - Consider memory usage and execution speed

4. **Maintainability**
   - Code that's easier to reason about
   - Testing and debugging considerations

### **Hybrid Approaches**

Modern development often combines paradigms:
- **OOP + Functional**: Use objects for structure, functions for data processing
- **Imperative + Declarative**: Mix detailed control with high-level abstractions
- **Functional + Logic**: Combine function composition with rule-based systems

## **Learning Path**
