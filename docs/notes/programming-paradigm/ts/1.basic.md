::: note
TypeScript was created by Microsoft in 2012 as a superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions. It was developed to help developers build large-scale JavaScript applications by providing type safety while maintaining JavaScript's flexibility and runtime behavior.
:::

### Fundamental Concepts

TypeScript's core is built on type safety and compile-time checking, providing JavaScript developers with tools to catch errors before runtime.

:::: card-grid
::: card title="Type Annotations" icon="mdi:code-braces"
Type annotations in TypeScript come after the variable name's declaration using the colon syntax (`:`). The TypeScript compiler features sophisticated type inference, making many annotations optional while still providing type safety.
:::

::: card title="Primitive Types" icon="mdi:variable"
TypeScript includes primitive types `number`, `string`, and `boolean`. These are distinct from their capitalized counterparts (`Number`, `String`, `Boolean`) which are object wrappers and should not be used in type definitions.
:::

::: card title="Type Safety" icon="mdi:shield-check"
TypeScript prevents variables from being assigned values of different types, catching common programming errors at compile time rather than runtime. This provides immediate feedback in development environments like VS Code.

### Type Annotations and Inference

TypeScript provides a powerful type system that can infer types from context while allowing explicit annotations when needed.

::: timeline
- **Basic Type Annotations**

  Type annotations follow the variable name and precede any assignment. TypeScript can often infer the type from the literal value, making annotations optional in simple cases.

  ```typescript
  let i: number = 123;        // Explicit annotation
  let j = 456;                // Type inferred as number
  let message: string = "Hello";
  let isActive: boolean = true;
  ```

- **Type Safety in Action**
  time=Step 2 icon=mdi:shield-alert placement=right
  
  TypeScript catches type mismatches at compile time, preventing runtime errors. The compiler provides detailed error messages in development environments.

  ```typescript
  let counter = 0;
  counter = "hello";  // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
  ```

- **Function Type Annotations**
  time=Step 3 icon=mdi:function-variant
  
  Function parameters and return types can be annotated, providing clear contracts for function usage and catching errors in function calls.

  ```typescript
  function add(x: number, y: number): number {
    return x + y;
  }
  
  // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
  add(5, "10");
  ```

### Why TypeScript Matters

TypeScript addresses JavaScript's dynamic typing challenges by providing compile-time type checking, making large-scale applications more maintainable and less error-prone.

- :+ **Enhanced Developer Experience**
  TypeScript provides immediate feedback in development environments. Features like autocompletion, error highlighting, and type documentation make development faster and more reliable.

- **Better Code Documentation**
  Type annotations serve as living documentation that stays in sync with the code. They clearly communicate the expected types and structure of data.

- **Refactoring Confidence**
  With comprehensive type checking, developers can make changes to large codebases with confidence that the type system will catch any breaking changes.

- **Modern JavaScript Features**
  TypeScript supports the latest ECMAScript features and can compile to older JavaScript versions, allowing developers to use modern syntax while maintaining browser compatibility.

### TypeScript vs JavaScript

Understanding the key differences between TypeScript and JavaScript helps developers appreciate the benefits of static typing.

:::: field-group
::: field name="Type Checking" type="string" default="dynamic"
JavaScript performs type checking at runtime, which can lead to unexpected errors. TypeScript performs type checking at compile time, catching errors before code runs.
:::

::: field name="Type Annotations" type="boolean" default="false"
JavaScript doesn't support type annotations. TypeScript adds optional type annotations that help catch errors and improve code documentation.
:::

::: field name="Compilation" type="boolean" default="false"
JavaScript runs directly in browsers and Node.js. TypeScript requires compilation to JavaScript before execution.
:::

::: field name="Tooling" type="string" default="standard"
JavaScript has good tooling support. TypeScript provides enhanced tooling with better autocompletion, refactoring, and error detection.

[+TypeAnnotation]:
A syntax in TypeScript where types are explicitly specified for variables, function parameters, and return types to ensure type safety and correctness.

[+TypeInference]:
The TypeScript compiler's ability to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its initial value, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.

[+StaticTyping]:
A programming language feature where type checking is performed at compile-time rather than runtime, catching errors before the code is executed.

[+Transpiling]:
The process of converting TypeScript code to JavaScript code, removing type annotations and ensuring compatibility with target environments.
