# A Comprehensive Guide to TypeScript Language Concepts

::: note
This guide provides a complete exploration of TypeScript's language concepts, from fundamentals to advanced topics. This covers type annotations, interfaces, generics, union types, optional properties, and how TypeScript enhances JavaScript with static type checking while maintaining full compatibility.

## **Course Structure**

### **Core Fundamentals**
1. **[Basic Concepts](./1.basic.md)** - Type annotations, primitive types, and type inference
2. **[Union Types](./2.union-types.md)** - Working with multiple types and type disambiguation
3. **[Interfaces](./3.interfaces.md)** - Object shapes and type definitions
4. **[Generic Types](./4.generics.md)** - Creating reusable type-safe components

### **Advanced Language Concepts**
5. **[Optional Properties](./5.optional-properties.md)** - Working with optional and readonly properties
6. **[Type Safety](./6.type-safety.md)** - Ensuring immutability and compile-time checking
7. **[Practical Applications](./7.practical-applications.md)** - Real-world TypeScript patterns and best practices

## **Learning Path**

This guide is structured to build knowledge progressively:

- **Start with Core Fundamentals** (Sections 1-4) to understand TypeScript's basic building blocks
- **Move to Advanced Concepts** (Sections 5-7) to master sophisticated typing patterns
- **Apply knowledge through practical examples** demonstrating TypeScript's power in real-world scenarios
